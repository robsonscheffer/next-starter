# Awesome UI

This is the place where you be able to see all the <s>hard</s> work to create isolated components.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

Keep UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.

### Getting Started

Any file that ends with **.stories.mdx** or **.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)** will be presented here.

- Don`t use the **/stories** directory to document your components, feel free to use to create some project documentation.
- The storybook configuration can be found in the **.storybook** directory
